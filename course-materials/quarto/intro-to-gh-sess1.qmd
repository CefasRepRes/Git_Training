## Welcome!

. . .

Some initial course info: ​

* You can find links to our draft schedule and all our course materials through our wiki.​

    * https://github.com/CefasRepRes/Git_Training/wiki/Schedule​

    * We will take breaks during the day!

* Feel free to interrupt and ask questions as we go.  ​

* H&S… ​


## Why use version control?

. . .

* How many people have directories that include files like this? 

    * `File_16062020.doc`, `File_30062020.doc`, ...
    * `File_old.doc`, `File_new.doc`
    * `File.doc.orig`
    * `File.doc`, `File_test.doc`

. . .

* Version control allows you to: 

    * Back up your code.

    * Keep track of changes. 

    * Share your code with others. 

    * Develop code with collaborators. 


## Changes are documented

. . .

* As code is backed up, can be confident in testing new ideas. 

* Version control software ensures that changes are attributable to individuals. 

    * If the code breaks, you know why!

* Code can be shared along with the documentation and file history.

    * Documentation can explain how and why the code should be used.

    * Can create fixed versions/releases, along with [DOIs](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).

        * Sharing now often required for publication. 
 
* All the above provides “quality assurance” in the final product. 


## Version control software

. . .

* Many options out there...

    * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software)
    
    * All are agnostic in terms of the programming language

* Client-server model :: all users share a single code repository.  

    * e.g., SVN (subversion) 

        * Legacy choice, depending on when project started (many now switching)?

* Distributed model :: all users have their own local repositories. Changes can be shared/merged as a separate step. 

    * e.g., Git

        * What we’re using today! 

        * Well supported, large user community, e.g.,

## So, what are Git & GitHub? 

. . .

:::: {.columns}

NB. These are two different things 

</br>

* Git = version control software.

* GitHub = web-based repository hosting service*. 

i.e. Git is the software behind the GitHub web service.

</br>

You can use Git without GitHub. However, GitHub provides useful tools (especially for sharing your code).
